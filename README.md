# amazon-dashboard
This project analyzes Amazon sales data to gain insights into product performance, order status, and customer purchase behavior. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard that helps track sales, fulfillment, and customer trends.The dataset includes details such as Order ID, Date, Status, Fulfillment Type, Product Category, SKU, Size, Sales Amount, Quantity, State, and B2B orders.

There are three KPI cards that are used in power bi for understanding dashboard more effective way -
* total number of B2B
* total sales
* sum of quantity
There are two colourful barcharts as you can see -
  first barchart , presenting total sales by sizes ( you can clearly see the highest sales done by M and lowest one is free size .To make a clear visulization ,there is a zoomslider for it) 
  second barchart , showing total sales by category (you can clearly see the highest sales done by Set and lowest one is Ethenic .To make a clear visulization ,there is a zoomslider for it)
Pie chart representing, Total sales by B2B
